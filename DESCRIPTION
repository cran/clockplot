Description: Provides a novel visualization technique for plotting timestamped events
    on a 24-hour circular clock face. This is particularly useful for analyzing
    daily patterns, event clustering, and gaps in temporal data. The package
    also generalizes this approach to create cyclic charts for other periods,
    including weekly and monthly cycles, enabling effective event planning and
    pattern analysis across multiple time frames.
